It started out as an umbrella organization for all of the Asian/Asian American student groups to coordinate and guide their different activities. In 1992, the AAAB gained A-status from the Northwestern&rsquo;s Associated Student Government. The organization began to make headlines in 1995 when APAC organized a successful hunger strike fighting for the creation of an Asian American Studies Program. The hunger strike garnered public support from universities all over the country and inspired a new generation of young Asian/Americans. In 2003, AAAB officially changed its name to The Asian Pacific American Coalition (APAC). The new name was intended to be more expansive and reflective of the diversity, heterogeneity, and differences in experiences of Asian American communities. Along with the name change, APAC remade its constitution and redefined its mission statement towards a more holistic outlook, making commitments to community building by addressing political, cultural, and social issues both within our own communities and with the rest of NU&rsquo;s student population through various programs and events. In the past, APAC has hosted events such as Asian American History Month, a screening of Better Luck Tomorrow with cast and director Justin Lin, Espresso Expressions, and speakers such as actor George Takei, music video director Joseph Kahn, SuChin Pak of MTV, Japanese Breakfast, and Alok Vaid-Menon.</div>\r\n<div class=\"x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x__2cuy x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x__3dgx x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x__2vxa\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div class=\"x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x__2cuy x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x__3dgx x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x__2vxa\">APAC strives to achieve the following:</div>\r\n<ul class=\"x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x__5a_q x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x__5yj1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<li class=\"x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x__2cuy x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x__509q x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x__2vxa\">Commit to accessibility and inclusion and decentering East Asian communities/supremacy</li>\r\n<li class=\"x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x__2cuy x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x__509q x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x__2vxa\">Recognize differences in lived experience and racialization within the umbrella of Asian, Asian American, and Pacific Islander peoples, as well as the experiences of multiracial peoples</li>\r\n<li class=\"x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x__2cuy x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x__509q x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x__2vxa\">Engage and mobilize the student community through activism and advocacy</li>\r\n<li class=\"x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x__2cuy x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x__509q x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x__2vxa\">Undertake intersectional grassroots activism and advocacy in the larger Northwestern community, Evanston, and Chicago</li>\r\n<li class=\"x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x__2cuy x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x__509q x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x__2vxa\">Foster collective healing from historical, intergenerational, and individual trauma</li>\r\n<li class=\"x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x__2cuy x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x__509q x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x__2vxa\">Empower individuals with marginalized identities</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>If you are interested in joining APAC, interest forms are open near the beginning of every quarter -- keep an eye out on the FB page and Instagram, or send our presidents Russell Leung (russellleung2024@u.northwestern.edu), Sophia Liu (sophialiu2024@u.northwestern.edu) or Neha Ramani (neharamani2024@u.northwestern.edu) an email!</p>","Summary":"From our unique position as similarly racialized peoples, Asian Pacific American Coalition builds community and power, in addition to raising awareness of historical, social, and political issues that affect marginalized communities at large.

Attending these events is not only a learning experience for chapter members, but also a way to gain access to other journalists and chapters of the organization to build connections. Additionally, it could help inspire members to create networks with experienced sports journalists.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Prospective events like resume workshops and article critiques with our faculty advisor, J.A. Adande, and other APSE journalists is something that will continue next year. These are a unique way to prepare for networking with APSE editors, as well as learn from chapter members. The events would be open to everyone &ndash; not just chapter members &ndash; which would allow individuals to take part in a learning experience, as well as show them the different elements of work that the chapter does.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A long-term goal for the chapter, which we hope to build on after our first year in existence, is creating a fundraising plan to subsidize trips to APSE conferences in the future. The key tenet of this organization is to introduce the benefits of APSE and its programming to students and, as previously mentioned, attending these meetings are a great way to grow as a chapter. Students can learn not only about sports writing at these events, but also the organizational structure of their favorite publications. Having enough money for a financial plan to fund these trips will allow students to not have to worry about the cost of such a trip, and be able to pursue their passion of sports journalism without short-term financial distress, removing further barriers from the complicated industry. Rachel Crader, the Chair of APSE&rsquo;s Great Lakes Region, has communicated with the proposed chapter&rsquo;s leadership regarding waived fees for student workers, and in some scenarios, additional covered costs for people participating on panels. Another option for ensuring students can attend APSE events is working with Northwestern&rsquo;s Student Organization Finance Office, which supports a wide range of organizations on campus.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another long-term goal that we hope to create after our first year would be having more APSE editors come to our sessions&nbsp;&ndash; whether in-person or virtually &ndash; to help members work on their resumes, cover letters and clips, as mentioned on the website. One of these individuals, Naila-Jean Meyers of the Star Tribune, spoke to our chapter this year as one of our multiple guests. While chapter members will likely end up networking with some of these journalists, it could be a great opportunity for the entire chapter to learn from a true industry professional, and give the individual the chance to share stories and skills with passionate students. This provides interested members both a glimpse at the editing side of the profession, as well as preparation for the industry and what employers look for in writing.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><br /><br /></p>","Summary":"The Northwestern student chapter of Associated Press Sports Editors, a national sports journalism organization.

Unlike any other place (or likely any other time in your life) the world is literally all around you. Take a look around you, I&rsquo;m willing to bet that within a few minutes of where you&rsquo;re sitting right now you can meet someone from a different country, a different culture, and a different family setting than your own. And you may not be able to see it right now, but within a number of years these very people that you are sitting around in class and living next to right now in your dorm, house or apartment building will be people who give shape to the culture, the community, the nation and the world! The campus is a pretty amazing place!</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>What&rsquo;s more, amidst this amazing setting we see that God is doing something big on the campus. Have you ever been confused about God? Have you ever felt disconnected from Him? Have you ever wondered if he was really real at all? Or maybe you believe that He is there, but you just don&rsquo;t feel close to Him or you are trying to figure out this faith thing. Well, our experience tells us that these are common questions for today&rsquo;s generation&mdash;and for those who wonder, more are discovering something real and fresh in a personal relationship with God! In fact if you&rsquo;ve ever wondered some of these things,take a few minutes now and email one of us.

Our sorority addresses this issue through leadership, outreach, individual, community interaction, and most importantly, the bonds of sisterhood. The sorority also promotes development among its members, the students and the faculty at each of the campuses we represent. In order to achieve this goal, we partake in political, social, educational, and cultural activities. Each effort improves our environment, and instills within our sisters experiences that will follow them long after they've graduated. Through a network of like-minded yet highly individualistic women, the sorority lends structure and support to sisters that share this Sigma vision. We believe the strength of our foundation derives from the unity of sisterhood, one that was proudly established years ago. In addition, we work in collaboration with other Greek and non-Greek organizations to provide services for the local communities and the community at large. It is through our various participation in these cultural events, educational workshops, and philanthropic support that we make a difference.

During the game, each player needs to logically come up with convincing speeches and reasonable deductions within a very short period of time.</p>\r\n<p><br />Many have found that they have become better at critical thinking and making impromptu speeches after participating. More importantly, they develop strong bonds among themselves while having great fun. This game is extremely popular among both undergraduate and graduate students (our first few trial events have attracted around 50 students each time). However, many students tend to stick to their own local groups and do not have the chance of meeting new players due to the lack of interaction between graduates and undergraduates. Also, it is very hard for them to find enough people each time. Our aim is to provide such<br />an opportunity to bring these excellent players together and help them meet new people, so they can share new strategies and improve their conversation and networking skills. Players of any experience level are welcome, and our members are ready and able to teach the game to any new players. We intend to host a weekly event for both undergraduates and graduates and participate in national tournaments (which are hosted sporadically). At this stage we mainly focus on Werewolves using Chinese, but ultimately we would like to include players from all of the world and introduce more strategic board games to our members.</p>","Summary":"Our organization mainly hosts \u2018The Werewolves of Millers Hollow\u2019 (\u2018Werewolves\u2019 in shorthand), which is a strategic board game involving 8 and 18 players debating.","CategoryIds":["4546","11213","17872"],"CategoryNames":["TGS-Sponsored","Recreation","Barrier-Free"],"Status":"Active","Visibility":"Public"},{"@search.score":1.0,"Id":"67848","InstitutionId":7,"ParentOrganizationId":19059,"BranchId":19059,"Name":"Wild Roots","ShortName":null,"WebsiteKey":"wildroots","ProfilePicture":"c00c5976-a40c-49f4-94f1-9027282e035a85fcbafd-7cdb-43ab-b522-468409185c8f.jpg","Description":"<p>Wild Roots Garden was founded at Northwestern University in the fall of 2009 through a collaboration between the One Book One Northwestern project, three undergraduate environmental student organizations (SEED, ECO, and ESW), Facilities Management, the graduate student garden, and Norris University Center. &nbsp; Today, Wild Roots is managed by undergraduate students. &nbsp;Our fresh produce is harvested and donated to community groups in Evanston.
